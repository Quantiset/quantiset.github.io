1. Introduction
Project Overview
The Collaboration Station project is designed to help kids with disabilities, especially Autism, break into the world of software engineering in a fun way â€” by learning how to create games in Scratch. The platform enables real-time collaboration, empowering users to build projects together with live co-editing features (think Google Docs). It integrates audio, video, and chat functionalities while seamlessly working with Scratch GUI, and supports breakout rooms for smaller team interactions.
